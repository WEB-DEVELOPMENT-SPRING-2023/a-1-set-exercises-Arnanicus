      So I just finished watching this movie, and wow... I loved it. This might sound weird but I LOVE anime that gets me all emotional and makes me wanna cry, and this movie did exactly that. It's a beautiful story about a developing friendship between two young people after learning the fact that the girl is gonna die from a pancreatic disease. I love that at the end of the movie our male protagonist finally learnt to be more open to people, as at the start he had no interest in making friends or interacting with anyone at all. I loved his charcter development
      The only thing I will disagree on about this movie is the genre, I wouldn't say it was a romance. I definately agree that it was a drama as it was very emotional and dramatic, but I'd put this in the Slice Of Life genre rather then romantic seeing as nothing happened between the protagonists. Sure, there was that bit in her diary towards the end where she confessed she thought she might've fallen in love with him, but as a whole they stay friends throughout the whole movie
      But wow... omg I can see now why a lot of people recommend this on YouTube, I would too. It's a great movie honestly, if you haven't watched it yet I suggest you should!

    I love it and i will always remember it... This is one of those few movies which really made me cry and i got so carried away in it...
    It's a very bittersweet, loving, cute movie. It teaches and also does make one question what life really means to one person. Especially when knowing the reality that life can easily be taken away at anytime. In this movie, I slowly relate but also care about the characters I slowly learn and love towards to. Seeing some of the precious moments and some twists makes me feel a little emotional. The animation in my opinion is great with the music and I love the story and what the message it's trying to get through. It's certainly worth watching in my opinion and I will certainly hope to watch it again
    If you want a film to show you a better life, this is your answer. This movie is so brilliant in both directing and writing that you will feel overflow of emotions that will make you cry. The title is unusual and that is what makes it more thought provoking. It sure did earn the sympathy of the audience through it's sensitive moral awareness and the wisdom of our life which can be snatch away anytime into the darkest realm of death with our wishes unfulfilled, unheard and untried. In the movie, you will encounter a title "Living With Dying" which is equally intertwined with this sensitive creation. I am recommending it to everyone

  It was really beautiful movie. I loved it, but as you know that Your Lie in April was also somewhat same as this, so that's why gave it four stars. But it is worth watching. It really brought mr on the brink of tears with just 1 and half hour movie. And also it kinda reminded me of my dear friend who also lost battle with cancer last year. I really miss her, and when watched this movie, I got total nostalgia.
