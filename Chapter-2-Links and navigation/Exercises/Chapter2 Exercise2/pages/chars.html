    <h3>'Me' / Haruki Shiga</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">Haruki Shiga or "Me" (as he is addressed before the end of the story) is the protagonist of the story and the first person to discover Sakura Yamauchi's secret. He is a plain-looking high school student who often wears a listless expression, according to his fellow classmates. At the start of the story, he is introverted, anti-social, and listless. Throughout the story with the help of Sakura, he learns how to express himself and his emotions, and to open up to other people. He learns how to care for people, love and be loved by people. </p>
    
    <h3>Sakura Yamauchi</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">She  is the deuteragonist of the story and the only friend of Haruki Shiga. She is a high school student who is well-liked by those around her due to her positive personality, but she is hiding a big secret: she has a terminal pancreatic disease and has been told she only has a few months left to live. Sakura is a teenage girl with a slim build, medium height, and is considered pretty (at least by Haruki Shiga). She is a very delightful, outgoing and kind person and has a good conscience as shown in the movie. Though she typically displays her rather air-headed side in most situations, deep down, Sakura is revealed to be incredibly scared of dying. Despite her illness, Sakura still remained determined to live her life to its fullest.</p>

    <h3>Kyoko Takimoto</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">She is one of the main supporting characters in the story. She is the the best friend of Sakura Yamauchi. Kyoko can come off as cold, aggressive, and even quite stubborn to most people, especially towards people whom she may find suspicious or doesn’t trust altogether, which is shown through her interactions with Haruki Shiga. She often makes futile attempts to convince Sakura that she shouldn’t be hanging out with Haruki, despite repeatedly being turned down by her. Kyoko is known to be sweet towards close friends like Sakura.</p>

    <h3>Takahiro</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">He is a supporting character in the story and the ex-boyfriend of Sakura Yamauchi. Takahiro has a good reputation and displays himself with a personality fitting to his position as a member of the student council. Though initially appearing to be generally polite and well-mannered, he was later on revealed to be the exact opposite. Being jealous of Haruki Shiga‘s good relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Sakura Yamauchi, Takahiro physically confronts him outside of Sakura’s house as he is leaving, even pridefully admitting to doing so and thinking that his actions would help her.</p>

    <h3>Gum Boy / Issei Miyata</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">He is a supporting character in the story. He's a classmate of Haruki Shiga, and someone he eventually befriends as Haruki learns to open up. Miyata displays himself as cool-headed and laid-back. He is shown to be easily distracted, shown when he talks to Haruki Shiga instead of doing his classwork. Overall, Miyata is generally a friendly person who is easy to get along with, and along with this is also shown to have an obsession with gum, as he is always seen carrying a pack with him and offering gum to other people who happen to walk by him or talk to him, like Haruki.</p>
