    <h2 id="plot">Plot Overview</h2>
    <p class="bodytext">A high school boy finds the diary of his classmate―only to discover that she’s dying. Sakura Yamauchi has been silently suffering from a pancreatic disease, and now exactly one person outside her family knows. He swears to her that he won’t tell anyone what he learned, and the shared secret brings them closer together in this deeply moving, first-person story that traces their developing relationship in Sakura’s final months of life.</p>

    <h2>Key Information</h2>
    <p class="bodytext">I Want to Eat Your Pancreas may look like a traditional romantic drama about a dying character, but it is a heartfelt celebration of life and friendships with a tight script and round characters. It is honestly amazing that this film works as well as it does, and that it still manages to surprise you with a few twists and turns that will have theatrical audiences crying in their seats. There’s also the theme of "chance versus fate" that runs through I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, the idea that fate is nothing but the result of thousands of choices we make though life. It’s a sentiment that makes you look at certain characters in a different light, and one that makes the “girl wants a boy to enjoy life” part of the story more profound than you’d think coming from a film with a title like this one.</p>

    <h2 id="chars">Characters</h2>

    <h3>'Me' / Haruki Shiga</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">Haruki Shiga or "Me" (as he is addressed before the end of the story) is the protagonist of the story and the first person to discover Sakura Yamauchi's secret. He is a plain-looking high school student who often wears a listless expression, according to his fellow classmates. At the start of the story, he is introverted, anti-social, and listless. Throughout the story with the help of Sakura, he learns how to express himself and his emotions, and to open up to other people. He learns how to care for people, love and be loved by people. </p>
    
    <h3>Sakura Yamauchi</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">She  is the deuteragonist of the story and the only friend of Haruki Shiga. She is a high school student who is well-liked by those around her due to her positive personality, but she is hiding a big secret: she has a terminal pancreatic disease and has been told she only has a few months left to live. Sakura is a teenage girl with a slim build, medium height, and is considered pretty (at least by Haruki Shiga). She is a very delightful, outgoing and kind person and has a good conscience as shown in the movie. Though she typically displays her rather air-headed side in most situations, deep down, Sakura is revealed to be incredibly scared of dying. Despite her illness, Sakura still remained determined to live her life to its fullest.</p>

    <h3>Kyoko Takimoto</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">She is one of the main supporting characters in the story. She is the the best friend of Sakura Yamauchi. Kyoko can come off as cold, aggressive, and even quite stubborn to most people, especially towards people whom she may find suspicious or doesn’t trust altogether, which is shown through her interactions with Haruki Shiga. She often makes futile attempts to convince Sakura that she shouldn’t be hanging out with Haruki, despite repeatedly being turned down by her. Kyoko is known to be sweet towards close friends like Sakura.</p>

    <h3>Takahiro</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">He is a supporting character in the story and the ex-boyfriend of Sakura Yamauchi. Takahiro has a good reputation and displays himself with a personality fitting to his position as a member of the student council. Though initially appearing to be generally polite and well-mannered, he was later on revealed to be the exact opposite. Being jealous of Haruki Shiga‘s good relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Sakura Yamauchi, Takahiro physically confronts him outside of Sakura’s house as he is leaving, even pridefully admitting to doing so and thinking that his actions would help her.</p>

    <h3>Gum Boy / Issei Miyata</h3>
    <p class="chardesc">He is a supporting character in the story. He's a classmate of Haruki Shiga, and someone he eventually befriends as Haruki learns to open up. Miyata displays himself as cool-headed and laid-back. He is shown to be easily distracted, shown when he talks to Haruki Shiga instead of doing his classwork. Overall, Miyata is generally a friendly person who is easy to get along with, and along with this is also shown to have an obsession with gum, as he is always seen carrying a pack with him and offering gum to other people who happen to walk by him or talk to him, like Haruki.</p>

      So I just finished watching this movie, and wow... I loved it. This might sound weird but I LOVE anime that gets me all emotional and makes me wanna cry, and this movie did exactly that. It's a beautiful story about a developing friendship between two young people after learning the fact that the girl is gonna die from a pancreatic disease. I love that at the end of the movie our male protagonist finally learnt to be more open to people, as at the start he had no interest in making friends or interacting with anyone at all. I loved his charcter development
      The only thing I will disagree on about this movie is the genre, I wouldn't say it was a romance. I definately agree that it was a drama as it was very emotional and dramatic, but I'd put this in the Slice Of Life genre rather then romantic seeing as nothing happened between the protagonists. Sure, there was that bit in her diary towards the end where she confessed she thought she might've fallen in love with him, but as a whole they stay friends throughout the whole movie
      But wow... omg I can see now why a lot of people recommend this on YouTube, I would too. It's a great movie honestly, if you haven't watched it yet I suggest you should!

    I love it and i will always remember it... This is one of those few movies which really made me cry and i got so carried away in it...
    It's a very bittersweet, loving, cute movie. It teaches and also does make one question what life really means to one person. Especially when knowing the reality that life can easily be taken away at anytime. In this movie, I slowly relate but also care about the characters I slowly learn and love towards to. Seeing some of the precious moments and some twists makes me feel a little emotional. The animation in my opinion is great with the music and I love the story and what the message it's trying to get through. It's certainly worth watching in my opinion and I will certainly hope to watch it again
    If you want a film to show you a better life, this is your answer. This movie is so brilliant in both directing and writing that you will feel overflow of emotions that will make you cry. The title is unusual and that is what makes it more thought provoking. It sure did earn the sympathy of the audience through it's sensitive moral awareness and the wisdom of our life which can be snatch away anytime into the darkest realm of death with our wishes unfulfilled, unheard and untried. In the movie, you will encounter a title "Living With Dying" which is equally intertwined with this sensitive creation. I am recommending it to everyone

  It was really beautiful movie. I loved it, but as you know that Your Lie in April was also somewhat same as this, so that's why gave it four stars. But it is worth watching. It really brought mr on the brink of tears with just 1 and half hour movie. And also it kinda reminded me of my dear friend who also lost battle with cancer last year. I really miss her, and when watched this movie, I got total nostalgia.
